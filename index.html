        <p>Dear Shikha,</p>
        <p>I don’t even know if you’ll ever see this, but I guess that doesn’t really matter. I just need to say this, even if it’s just for my own peace of mind.</p>
        <p>I messed up. I was rude, emotional, and immature, and I hurt you in ways I never should have. I pushed you away when I should have held on. And now, after all this time, I find myself missing you more than I can even put into words.</p>
        <p>I don’t blame you for blocking me. Honestly, I probably deserve worse. But I just want you to know—I’m sorry. Truly. You didn’t deserve the way I treated you. You were always there, always patient, always giving, and I took that for granted. Looking back, I wish I had been better for you, for us.</p>
        <p>The thing is, I still care about you. I still want the best for you, even if I’m not a part of your life anymore. I hope you’re happy. I hope you’re surrounded by people who make you feel safe, loved, and appreciated the way you should be.</p>
        <p>I won’t lie and say I don’t wish things were different. That I don’t wish I could hear your voice again, share stupid jokes, or just sit in comfortable silence like we used to. But I know some things can’t be undone.</p>
        <p>So, wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, I hope you’re doing okay. More than okay. I hope you’re healthy. And if you ever think of me, I just hope it’s with a little bit of warmth and not pain.</p>
        <p>Take care, Bebu. You’ll always be my first love.</p>
        <p>Yongkong<br>(Your Bebu)</p>

        <h2>PS.</h2>
        <p>I LOVE YOU.</p>
